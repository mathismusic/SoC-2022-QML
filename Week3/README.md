# Week 3
We discuss the Quantum Fourier Transform and applications. Reading is parts of Chap 5 of QCQI.
    We first discuss the Quantum Fourier transform and a nice compact form for it. This motivates a simple implementation of the transform and also proves that the transform is unitary(though that can be proved directly from the definition as well). We then discuss Phase estimation, which is a very clever way to compute the phase of a (unit modulus) eigenvalue of a unitary operator(its order must be a power of 2, though). We also analyse the performance of the algorithm and the probability of success. Finally we implement the algorithm in Qiskit. 
    Next, we look at Order finding. It solves the classic problem of finding the order of a number modulo another(if this was classically so trivial, a lot of IMO problems would have been much easier :) ) using phase-estimation of a well-chosen unitary operator. I wonder how they came up with that operator though, once you get some of its eigenvalues it makes a lot of sense, but how would someone come up with it in the first place? The order-finding algorithm uses an oracle that can compute powers of the unitary applied to a qubit register. It also uses phase-estimation as a subroutine and a bit of fraction manipulation as a classical subroutine at the end. Finally we get our order $r$ with high probability(with the probability of success of the phase-estimation subroutine). A clever point here is that we make use of the fact that the eigenvectors in question when weighted with a phase sum up to $|1\rangle$, so we needn't specifically prepare an eigenstate(which incidentally, would likely not even be possible since the eigenstate requires that you know $r$, or conversely, if it were possible, then we could possibly extract $r$ from it itself! - perhaps it is indeed possible to prepare it though, that's something to think about!)
    Shor:
    
    
Then we discuss Quantum Search and Grover's algorithm. Reading is parts of Chap 6 of QCQI. The geometric idea behind Grover's algorithm is simply superb, it was so so nice.
  Two nice points to note: Using $\frac{|0\rangle - |1\rangle}{\sqrt{2}}$ as the target to the oracle is a good idea(Grover) & also,
