# Summer of Code 2022 - Quantum Machine Learning
We learn some Quantum Computing, Machine Learning and then put these together to implement some Quantum Machine Learning!

There are 7 folders labelled Weeks 1 through 5, Eval(QC Eval) and QML_Eval. These each contain that week's code and a README regarding the details of the topics and code for that week.

The approximate timeline is:
- Week 1(QC): 25/4 - 5/5
- Week 2(QC): 5/5 - 12/5(Theory), a bit during the first week of June after Midsems, 30/6 - 5/7(Code).
- Week 3(QC): 5/7 - 17/7
- QC Eval: 17/7 - 20/7
- Week 4(ML): 19/7 - 22/7(I had seen some ML before so this week was easy to complete quickly)
- Week 5(QML): 21/7 - 24/7, 26/7 - 27/7
- QML Eval: 24/7 - 28/7
