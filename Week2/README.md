# Week 2
This week, we explored quantum circuits - what we can do with them, and how to implement them using a small existing set of gates.
First, we looked at single-qubit gates. The rotation matrices $R_x(\theta), R_y(\theta), R_z(\theta)$ constructed in terms of the Pauli matrices X, Y and Z together with a Z-Y decomposition of a general unitary help us prove the result I found the most fantastic(its usage in multiple qubit gate construction was really nice) of all this week - Any unitary can be written as $e^{\iota \alpha}$AXBXC with ABC = I.
