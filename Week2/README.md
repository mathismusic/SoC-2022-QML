# Week 2
This week, we explored quantum circuits - what we can do with them, and how to implement them using a small existing set of gates.

First, we looked at single-qubit gates. The rotation matrices $R_x(\theta), R_y(\theta), R_z(\theta)$ constructed in terms of the Pauli matrices $X$, $Y$ and $Z$ together with a $Z-Y$ decomposition of a general unitary help us prove my favorite result(its usage in controlled multiple qubit gate construction was just really nice) of this week of all this week - Any unitary can be written as $e^{\iota \alpha}AXBXC$ with $ABC = I$.

Onward to controlled multiple qubit gates. Using the controlled-$X$ gate and single qubit unitaries, we can implement a general controlled-$U$ gate. More specifically, the $V^2 = U$(as I like to call it) or Sleator-Weinfurter construction specifies the exact circuit to build a general controlled-$U$ gate. It's an ingenious idea, utilizing $V \cdot V = U$, but $V^* \cdot V = I$. Now for the best result: a controlled-$U$ gate may be implemented directly and simply if we know its decomposition into a phase times $AXBXC$ for unitaries $A$, $B$, $C$ whose product is $I$. Like the $V^2 = U$ construction, this also relies on the simple but crucial facts that $A \cdot X \cdot B \cdot X \cdot C$ is $U$, but $A \cdot I \cdot B \cdot I \cdot C$ is $I$.
