# Week 4
This week we look at some standard ML problems and techniques. Topics range from Linear Regression to simple CNNs.
linReg.ipynb: Linear Regression on the weatherHistory dataset.
iris.ipynb: unsupervised k-means clustering to classify flowers into species just with unlabeled data. Dataset is the iris dataset.
svm.ipynb: SVM regression on the breast cancer dataset to (binary) classify a cancer into benign and malignant.
mnist.ipynb: a simple CNN network in TensorFlow to process images from the MNIST dataset.
